 The basic idea of this sample app is to try and implement the latest features like MVVM, JetPack components, Retrofit, Coroutines, Hilt, LiveData, etc.

 This app is under construction.
 1.  like Jetpack, Coroutines, Hilt, etc. 
 2. Secondly, convert "MVVM" to "MVVM CLEAN architecture," which is in progress. 
 3. Tested Sign In screen and EventListViewModel to fetch API responses, but ATM, the base URL, needs to be fixed. 
 4. Other screens like PrescriptionViewModel, and AppointmentDetailsFragment is under construction
 5. it works with mock data, fetching API services under implementation from FireBase.
 6. Need to write test cases using Junit and Espresso.
 7. Planning to add more UI elements and screens
